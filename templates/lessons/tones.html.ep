<h1>Tones</h1>

<p>
There are 8 tones in Teochew. In many resources, you will see a number after
each syllable, indicating which tone it is.

<p>I like to categorize the tones into these subsets:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Tones 1, 5, and 7</b> have a steady pitch. Note that these are relative&#8212;the exact pitches will vary from person to person.</li>
<li><b>Tones 2 and 6</b> change in pitch while you say them.</li>
<li><b>Tones 4 and 8</b> are checked tones that always have an ending sound with h, k, or p.</li>
<li><b>Tone 3</b> subtly falls and rises, but it honestly sounds indistinguishable from tone 7 to me. (They have different tone change rules though!) Different people will stress how much rising/falling to use here.
</ul>

<p>
Many words undergo tone change when placed in front of another word. This is
called <b>sandhi</b>. The table below shows the same words as above, but placed
in front of another word to demonstrate how their tones change.

<p>In the translations on this site, if a word has undergone tone change, the
spoken tone will be displayed in parentheses. If a word originally has tone 3 and undergoes tone change, I will always display tone 2 for it, but my audio clips will vary between actually saying it with tone 2 or tone 5. I'm not consistent, and it's mainly because it takes more effort to say something with tone 2 in the middle of a phrase ðŸ˜…
